Our top of the line reservation software aims to solve the problem of decision making in a hotel management context. We will have a catalog consisting of various room types that our guests can choose from along with varying amenities, meal plans, and additional services. The guest can choose whether they want a room with a view or without using the set up inputs, and we will have default packages and options that the guest can use as a template if they can't decide or just simply want a room.

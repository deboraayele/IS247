The Hotel Reservation System is an application made to manage hotel bookings. It allows users to book hotel rooms, cancel reservations, and view their booking history if they have one. This system guarantees that all customer data and room availability are handled properly on an easy-to-use interface. Managing hotel reservations manually can be difficult, but this project aims to solve this problem.

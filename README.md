Our top of the line reservation software aims to simplify the process of booking hotel rooms, making it easier for customers to both book and cancel their reservations. We offer two types of rooms: single and double, each with set prices. A single room costs $100 per night, while a double room costs $150.  We simply ask the customer to enter some information, their check-in date and their check-out date and the system automatically calculates the room price. To cancel a booking, customers only need to enter their Reservation ID, which is provided upon successful booking. Lastly, we provide an option to view booked rooms, allowing customers to check hotel occupancy or retrieve their booking details if needed.
